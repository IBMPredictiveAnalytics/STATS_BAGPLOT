<h1>STATS BAGPLOT Extension Command</h1>

<p>Produce a bagplot.  Bagplots are two-dimensional 
versions of the boxplot.  Instead of a box, the bagplot displays 
a convex polygon that contains half of the points (the bag).
The loop is a polygon that contains the non-outlier points.
Outlier points are those beyond the fence multiple of the bag.</p>

<p>If there are more than two variables, a matrix of bagplots is
produced.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p>STATS BAGPLOT VARIABLES=<em>list of variables</em><sup>&#42;</sup>
CASELIMIT=<em>number</em></p>

<p>/OPTIONS FENCE=<em>number</em> OUTLIERS=YES or NO
WHISKERS=YES or NO LOOPPOINTS=YES or NO
BAGPOINTS=YES or NO POINTSIZE=<em>number</em>
TITLE=&ldquo;<em>title text</em>&rdquo;</p>



<p><sup>&#42;</sup> Required<br/>
<sup>&#42;&#42;</sup> Default</p>
</div>
<p>STATS BAGPLOT /HELP.  prints this information and does nothing else.</p>

<pre class="example"><code>STATS BAGPLOT VARIABLES=salary educ.
</code></pre>

<p>Split files mode is supported for this procedure.  Missing
values are always excluded.</p>

<p><strong>VARIABLES</strong> specifies the names of the variables to be plotted.
Nominal-level variables cannot be used, and if there are value
labels, no two values of a variable should have the same label.</p>

<p><strong>CASELIMIT</strong> specifies the number of cases above which some statistics
will be computed based on a sample of the data.  The default is 300.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p><strong>FENCE</strong> specifies the multiple of the bag polygon outside of which
points are classified as outliers.  The default is 3.</p>

<p><strong>TITLE</strong> optionally specifies a title for the plot.  If there are more
than two variables, the split information is used as the title
if no TITLE was specified.</p>

<p><strong>POINTSIZE</strong> specifies a scale factor to increase or decrease the
default size of points.  The default is .6.</p>

<p>The remaining parameters are ignored if there are more than
two variables, because the R package does not honor them.</p>

<p><strong>OUTLIERS</strong> determines whether outliers are plotted.</p>

<p><strong>WHISKERS</strong> specifies whether whiskers are drawn.</p>

<p><strong>LOOPPOINTS</strong> specifies whether the points between the bag and
loop boundaries are drawn.</p>

<p><strong>BAGPOINTS</strong> specifies whether points within the bag boundary
are drawn.</p>
